# Serverless CRUD Key Value

> Learning project to experiment with AWS DynamoDB in a serverless Vue app

##

In order to get this project running you have to:

- Create a DynamoDB table with its primary key named 'key' (String).
- Create an Identity Pool using AWS Cognito service, with access to unauthenticated identities. [Enable access to unauthenticated identities checkbox]. This will also create a new role in your IAM AWS Service.
- Create a custom IAM Policy to allow the CRUD operations over the Items in your recently created DynamoDB table:

``` bash
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "dynamodb:PutItem",
                "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                "dynamodb:GetItem",
                "dynamodb:Scan",
                "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:dynamodb:your-region:account-id:table/your-fancy-table"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

- Associate this custom Policy to the role generated by the Identity Pool.

With your AWS account set, just run:

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

```

Visit http://localhost:8080
